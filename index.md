## Hey there. I'm Doug.

![Image of Doug Weltman](https://github.com/dougweltman/dougweltman.github.io/blob/master/IMG_1600.jpg)

I work on tech businesses and the products that enable them. This includes:
- Product
- Business model design / "New Bets"
- Investments

Currently, I'm playing with [Quadratick](http://www.quadratick.com), a web application I built to encourage adoption with [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting). I also help businesses and investors think about their market, product and resource allocation opportunities.

Previously, I worked in an unusual, product-focused strategy role at Yahoo! & AOL, where I was the analytical lead for a set of B2B adtech and B2B2C on-device lines of business representing $1 billion+ in revenue.

Before Yahoo!/AOL, I worked in product, operations and growth at an enterprise SaaS startup in New York.

I live in London.


## Skills and Projects

Below you can find some projects I've worked on or some models that you're free to peruse.

#### [Quadratick](http://www.quadratick.com): Quadratic Voting for Everybody
Continuing from my final project for HarvardX's CS50, I built Quadratick to let users set up, share and take polls using the quadratic voting method. Quadratic voting encodes information about the strengths of respondent preferences.

This project has two goals: 1) to develop a working web application from scratch, then using it as a base to experiment with other technologies, and 2) to improve the public's understanding of the implementation and implications of alternative voting methods.

Developed using Flask (Python), PostgreSQL, JavaScript and HTML/Bootstrap. Deployed on Heroku.

#### Models

##### [Sizing opportunities across the programmatic adtech value chain](https://github.com/dougweltman/excel_models/blob/master/US_Programmatic_Market_2020.xlsx)
Questions around *addressable* market are often glossed over or ignored in the adtech world, where larger headline numbers are favoured. In fact, a signicant amount of spending on digital programmatic advertising is routed to supply that is difficult for emergent businesses to address, like Google's, Facebook's and Twitter's. Likewise, spending that uses data assets that are difficult to unseat like Amazon's behavioral and intent graph is also difficult to address.

The second order question is how mobile carriers need to think about opportunities in adtech.

This exercise takes a quick look at two key questions:
1) How any adtech business needs to be thinking about its market opportunities, and
2) The scale constraints any telco looking for an adtech play would need to confront

#### [SQL exercises](https://github.com/dougweltman/SQL-exercises#readme)

A few exercises to showcase proficiency around selects, joins, conditions and other fairly basic SQL operations.


## Writing

##### [Is nuclear energy a rich country's game?](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/is-nuclear-power-a-rich-countrys-game-b60c1ff5f8c4?source=friends_link&sk=b6a8afb54d0a1910e3fe31ab64ce2869) *Confidence: N/A*
Nuclear energy can solve a lot of the problems of fossil fuels, especially in countries with air pollution problems. But how do smaller economies absorb the costs of a Fukushima-scale accident?

##### [The Cheapest Covid-19 Response is the Most Expensive](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/the-cheapest-covid-19-response-is-the-most-expensive-c58b87c41b6c?source=friends_link&sk=1ab10e48a4bc92136258139a669d4763) *Confidence: Low (2/7)*
A quick, cocktail napkin analysis of the social and economic dislocation of different Covid-19 policies suggests the priority must be to shorten the time needed to end the outbreak.

##### [The Trouble Competing with Tesla](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/the-trouble-competing-with-tesla-8a35a13e7a6?source=friends_link&sk=a87e6bb30f4eb023a828a6974158cad8) *Confidence: High (6/7)*
Consider a world where traditional carmakers can make good electric vehicles. Will making a good EV be enough?
Different failure modes for EV product launches reveal the gaps, whether they can be filled, and, on examination, the different ways that Tesla is disrupting the auto industry.
Finally, what happens when a new competitor disrupts your high-overhead distribution model?

##### [The Long-term Economics of Podcast Distribution](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/will-the-future-economics-of-podcast-distribution-look-more-like-spotify-or-facebook-a1d7cb19815a?source=friends_link&sk=1893410414dc455a89d70c7e380bfb55) *Confidence: Medium (4/7)*
Why is Facebook better at making money than Netflix and Spotify? Wholesale transfer pricing, content aggregation and an approach to thinking about podcast distribution.

##### [Smart Cities are Dumb, usually.](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/smart-cities-are-dumb-48a680a1d84a?source=friends_link&sk=3e63b5261b79893c9134b4c214ba04b0) *Confidence: Medium-low (3/7)*
Smart cities analytics and its tech stack represent only modest commercial opportunities, and are limited by four interlocking factors.

##### [Niche Plays in Smart Cities.](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/niche-plays-in-smart-cities-and-municipal-iot-d71d93a7117?source=friends_link&sk=91dc1402e6219890d37891be953a3363) *Confidence: Low (2/7)*
Because it's dumb to label an entire sector as dumb.

##### [Monetizing Tumblr and the challenge of categorizing content](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/monetizing-tumblr-the-challenge-of-categorizing-content-3c81420cb173?source=friends_link&sk=e71a27932a3af7cef548b0742ffa783b) *Confidence: Medium-high (5/7)*
Tumblr's product was incompatible with a business model like Yahoo's. Decisions baked into how content was organized on Tumblr undermined the value of its ad inventory.

##### [Facebook is not supply-constrained](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/rumors-of-facebooks-demise-are-greatly-exaggerated-efb8676a4060?source=friends_link&sk=e7ff6cd84d07a544678c5aaab9385351) *Confidence: Part 1: Medium-low (2/7); Part 2: Speculative (1/7)*
Mark Zuckerberg in 2018 announced that Facebook's newsfeed would show more personal content. Investors responded unfavorably, perhaps fearing crimped ad revenues. 
1) As-yet unconstrained supply might make this a dead-wrong analysis on the ads revenue piece, and 
2) there is significant upside to Facebook in new, non-ads-based revenue streams as it experiments with enabling new marketplace models.
