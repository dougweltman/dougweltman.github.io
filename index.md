## Hey there. I'm Doug.

I work on tech businesses and the products that enable them. This includes:
- Product
- Business model design / "New Bets"
- Investments

Currently, I'm playing with [Quadratick](http://www.quadratick.com), a web application I built to encourage familiarity of [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting).

I also help investors and businesses think about their market, product and resource allocation opportunities.

Previously, I worked in an unusual, product-focused strategy role at Yahoo! & AOL, where I was the analytical lead for a set of B2B adtech and B2B2C on-device lines of business representing $1 billion+ in revenue. Before that, I worked in product, operations and growth at an information services startup in New York.

I live in London.

## Writing
[The Cheapest Covid-19 Response is the Most Expensive](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/the-cheapest-covid-19-response-is-the-most-expensive-c58b87c41b6c?source=friends_link&sk=1ab10e48a4bc92136258139a669d4763) A quick, cocktail napkin analysis of the social and economic dislocation of different Covid-19 policies suggests the priority must be to shorten the time needed to end the outbreak.

[The Trouble Competing with Tesla](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/the-trouble-competing-with-tesla-8a35a13e7a6?source=friends_link&sk=a87e6bb30f4eb023a828a6974158cad8) Consider a world where traditional carmakers can make good electric vehicles. Will making a good EV be enough?
Different failure modes for EV product launches reveal the gaps, whether they can be filled, and, on examination, the different ways that Tesla is disrupting the auto industry.
Finally, what happens when a new competitor disrupts your high-overhead distribution model?

[The Long-term Economics of Podcast Distribution](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/will-the-future-economics-of-podcast-distribution-look-more-like-spotify-or-facebook-a1d7cb19815a?source=friends_link&sk=1893410414dc455a89d70c7e380bfb55) Why is Facebook better at making money than Netflix and Spotify? Wholesale transfer pricing, content aggregation and an approach to thinking about podcast distribution.

[Smart Cities are Dumb*.](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/smart-cities-are-dumb-48a680a1d84a?source=friends_link&sk=3e63b5261b79893c9134b4c214ba04b0) Smart cities analytics and its tech stack represent only modest commercial opportunities, and are limited by four interlocking factors.

[Niche Plays in Smart Cities.](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/niche-plays-in-smart-cities-and-municipal-iot-d71d93a7117?source=friends_link&sk=91dc1402e6219890d37891be953a3363) Because it's dumb to label an entire sector as dumb.

[Monetizing Tumblr and the Challenge of Categorizing Content](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/monetizing-tumblr-the-challenge-of-categorizing-content-3c81420cb173?source=friends_link&sk=e71a27932a3af7cef548b0742ffa783b) Tumblr's product was incompatible with a business model like Yahoo's. Decisions baked into how content was organized on Tumblr undermined the value of its ad inventory.

[Rumors of Facebook's Demise have been Greatly Exaggerated](https://medium.com/@douglasweltman/rumors-of-facebooks-demise-are-greatly-exaggerated-efb8676a4060?source=friends_link&sk=e7ff6cd84d07a544678c5aaab9385351) Mark Zuckerberg in 2018 announced that Facebook's newsfeed would show more personal content. Investors responded unfavorably, perhaps fearing crimped ad revenues. 
1) This might have been a dead-wrong analysis on the ads revenue piece, and 
2) there is significant upside to Facebook in new, non-ads-based revenue streams as it experiments with enabling new marketplace models.
